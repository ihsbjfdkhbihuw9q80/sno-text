# Understanding Sleep Apnea

## Sleep apnea is a serious disorder that can be life-threatening if left untreated.

## What is Sleep Apnea?

**Sleep apnea** is a condition that makes you stop breathing while you’re sleeping. This happens either because of a **blocked airway (obstructive sleep apnea)** or because the **brain doesn’t control breathing properly (central sleep apnea)**. A lack of oxygen activates a reflex that wakes you briefly to resume breathing, disrupting your sleep cycle and stressing your heart.

## Types of Sleep Apnea

There are three main types of sleep apnea:

- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Throat muscles relax and block airflow.
- **Central sleep apnea (CSA)**: The brain fails to send signals to breathing muscles.
- **Mixed/Complex sleep apnea**: A combination of OSA and CSA.

### How Common is Sleep Apnea?

An estimated **1 billion people** worldwide (ages 30 to 69) have obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is less common but still significant.

## Symptoms and Risk Factors

### Symptoms of Sleep Apnea

Typical symptoms include **repeated nighttime awakenings**, breathing pauses, unusual breathing patterns, **loud snoring**, waking up choking or short of breath, and **daytime fatigue**. Other signs include morning headaches, night sweats, mood changes, restless sleep, and sexual dysfunction. Symptoms in children may differ.

### Causes and Risk Factors

Causes include upper airway blockages or problems with brain regulation of breathing. Risk factors include family history, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, **obesity**, large tonsils, and aging. **Men** are more likely to be diagnosed before age 50, but anyone—regardless of body size—can develop sleep apnea.

## Complications and Severity

### Complications

Untreated sleep apnea can cause excessive daytime sleepiness, **arrhythmias**, high blood pressure, heart damage, **heart failure**, **stroke**, and even **sudden cardiac death**.

### Severity Levels

Severity is measured by the **apnea/hypopnea index (AHI)**:

- **Mild**: 5–14 events/hour
- **Moderate**: 15–29 events/hour
- **Severe**: 30+ events/hour

### Organs Affected

Sleep apnea impacts multiple systems, especially the **circulatory system (heart)** and **nervous system (brain)**.

## Diagnosis, Treatment, and Outlook

### Diagnosis and Tests

Diagnosis involves medical history, symptom review, and sleep studies. The two main tests are **polysomnography** (in-lab sleep study with sensors) and **home sleep apnea testing**. Videos or recordings of nighttime breathing can also provide important evidence.

### Treatment Options

Treatment depends on type and severity. Options include **CPAP machines**, oral appliances, sleeping position changes, NMES devices, medications, and surgery. Surgical options include jaw surgery, nasal surgery (e.g., septoplasty), and throat procedures to prevent airway blockage.

### Outlook and Prognosis

There is **no universal cure**. Weight loss or surgery may cure some OSA cases. Left untreated, sleep apnea can **reduce life expectancy** due to severe complications. With treatment, patients can manage symptoms and significantly improve quality of life.

## Prevention and Emergency

### Prevention

Not all cases can be prevented, but risks can be reduced by **maintaining healthy weight**, eating well, exercising regularly, practicing good sleep hygiene, **avoiding smoking and alcohol**, and managing conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.

### Living With Sleep Apnea

Self-care includes making lifestyle changes, sticking to treatment plans, and staying in touch with healthcare providers. Regular follow-ups help ensure treatments remain effective.

### When to Seek Emergency Help

Go to the ER if you experience symptoms of **heart attack** (chest pain, cold sweats, shortness of breath), **stroke** (sudden weakness, vision changes, dizziness), or **difficulty breathing**.
